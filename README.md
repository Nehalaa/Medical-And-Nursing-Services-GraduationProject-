The whole goal of this project is to provide a suitable doctor quickly, especially if this patientâ€™s condition is critical
 Regarding the doctor: 1- The doctor can register, and the system does not accept this doctor unless 
 he confirms that he is a doctor already registered in the union and also pays the monthly subscription for this system through
 the Stripe portal by sending the payment link to his email address that he entered when registering. Then the doctor enters this. 
 The link: If the payment process is completed, the payment completion process page appears, and if the payment is not completed, the payment is not completed page appears.
 Secondly, he can log in as long as his subscription to this system continues. 2- He can manage and confirm his reservations, and he also has the right to evaluate the reservation, 
 and the patient can also write to this. The doctor is via chat, and the doctor can see his messages and send the Zoom link in case of online detection
